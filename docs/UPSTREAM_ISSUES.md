# Upstream issues

Every open issue on [sbabcock23/hass-tryfi](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues)
as of 10 November 2026, and what this fork does about it. Where an issue traced
back to pytryfi rather than the integration, the fix is in the vendored copy
and listed in [`pytryfi/VENDORED.md`](../custom_components/tryfi/pytryfi/VENDORED.md).
Most have a test named after the failure.

## Fixed

| Issue | Report | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [#115](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/115) | Does this integration exfiltrate data? | pytryfi 0.0.21 starts a third-party error reporter that captures every error in Home Assistant. | Vendored pytryfi with it removed; a test fails if any file names it. |
| [#113](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/113), [#111](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/111) | Options flow: 500 error | The handler assigned the now read-only `config_entry`. | Rewritten options flow. |
| [#109](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/109) | Deprecated `TrackerEntity` alias | Imported from `.config_entry`. | Imported from the package. |
| [#104](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/104), [#91](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/91), [#56](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/56) | Data stops updating until a reload | No timeout on any request, so a connection that died silently hung the poll for ever; failures were swallowed so data went stale without a sign; no way to sign in again. | 30-second timeouts; failures reach the coordinator, so entities go unavailable; one fresh sign-in per failed poll; a rejected password starts re-authentication. |
| [#102](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/102), [#99](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/99), [#96](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/96), [#87](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/87), [#67](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/67), [#62](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/62), [#61](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/61) | Only the bases show up / a collar missing | pytryfi compared a pet's device with the string `"None"`, but TryFi sends `null`; one pet without a collar (a Nano chip, a cat, a shared pet) abandoned every pet. Any other odd pet did the same. | Collarless pets skipped; each pet loaded on its own; one that fails cannot hide the others. |
| [#100](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/100), [#69](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/69) | `FiDevice` has no `_mode` / `_ledOn` | Collar fields were read in one block; the first missing one left the rest undefined. | Every field defaults; fields read in independent groups; entities show unknown. |
| [#93](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/93) | Base missing attributes breaks setup | Same pattern in `FiBase`. | Defaults, and fields read with `.get`. |
| [#107](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/107) | "Could not set place" log spam | Logged by a later pytryfi on every poll while walking. | Not present in the vendored copy; `place: null` handled quietly. |
| [#106](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/106) | Cannot sign in on a fresh install | Every failure surfaced as `CannotConnect` with a traceback. | Wrong password and unreachable cloud are told apart (`invalid_auth`, `cannot_connect`). |
| [#86](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/86), [#80](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/80) | `async_forward_entry_setup` | Fixed in upstream 0.0.26. | Kept (`async_forward_entry_setups`). |
| [#79](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/79), [#52](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/52) | Polling rate ignored | Only `entry.data` was read. | Options first, then data; saving reloads; floor of 60 s. |
| [#78](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/78), [#77](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/77), [#59](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/59) | Deprecated constants | | Enums throughout. |
| [#71](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/71) | How to change Lost Mode from an automation | `input_select.select_option` was used. | Documented: `select.select_option`. Commands now raise an error when TryFi refuses them. |
| [#60](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/60) | Which base is the collar on? | Not exposed. | `base_id` and `base_name` attributes on Connected to. |
| [#35](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/35) | Dog's current state | Activity type showed `OngoingRest`. | An enum sensor: Resting / Walking; plus Connected to (phone = with a person). |
| [#24](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/24) | Change LED colour | Already supported. | Kept; nearest colour the collar offers. |
| [#23](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/23) | km or miles | No device class, so no unit conversion. | Distance and duration device classes: change the unit per entity, and new installs follow the unit system. |

## Not fixable here

| Issue | Report | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [#89](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/89) | Sleep/nap stopped updating | The reporter's own debugging showed TryFi returning zero for the daily rest summary while the app had data. Documented in [ENTITIES.md](ENTITIES.md). |
| [#83](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/83) | Tap shows history, not a map | Home Assistant's card and dialog behaviour, set in the dashboard. The tracker is no longer filed under Diagnostic, which puts it at the top of the device page. |
| [#51](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/51) | MySQL "illegal mix of collations" | A database character-set setting meeting an emoji in a pet's name. |
| [#57](https://github.com/sbabcock23/hass-tryfi/issues/57) | Homebridge | Out of scope. |
